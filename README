It's easier to just start with a fresh AVD (emulator instance).

`android create avd -n play -t 1 --abi x86`

Then you can start the emulator with the `start-emu` script.

The play store cannot be run in the emulator without specific dependencies:

GoogleLoginService
GoogleServicesFramework
Phonesky

The APKs in this repo are those service APKs from /system/app that have had
their Google signatures wiped and been resigned with the provided debug key.

Before installing the play store (modified or otherwise), you must copy these
modified files over to the emulator:

`./push-prereqs` will set permissions and copy the files over.

To start working on the play store APK:

`unzip com.android.vending_3.9.16.apk -d play_apk`

In the play_apk directory, run:

`rm -rf META-INF` to destroy the Google signature
`baksmali classes.dex` to decompile the Dalvik bytecode to smali

The smali files will be in the `out` directory.  Edit the files as
needed and then:

`smali -o classes.dex out` to overwrite classes.dex with the reassembled
Dalvik bytecode from the modified smali files.

`rm -rf out` to remove the smali files so you can zip up the APK.

`zip -r play_apk.apk *`

Move the play_apk.apk file up one directory and sign it with the debug key:

`./sign-apk-debug-key play_apk`

which will create play_apk-signed.apk. 

`adb install -r play_apk-signed.apk` to install the modified play store
APK in the emulator.
